LichMaster is my first attempt at an application. Once compiled, this program assist with running campaigns in the Genesys roleplaying system. LichMaster allows users to:
- create adversaries
- create campaigns and log sessions
- upload created adversaries into a combat manager
- track initiative
- track damage on adversaries
